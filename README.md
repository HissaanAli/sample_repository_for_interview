# sample_repository_for_interview ðŸš€

A sample repository to showcase the clustering of my algorithm to find similar products and make recommendations.


# What you are looking at ?

You are looking at the clusters made by my algorithm when through some images scrapped off from the catawiki website. It shows the potential of my algorithm to cluster auction items and the ability to make relevant recommendations. This was NOT developed for auction items, but it shows that without any changing anything, it still does a good job. 

# I can't see the code ?

This is because the algorithm was developed as part of my job at the company I work at Dubai. Due to privacy concerns of the company I couldn't share the code publically, but I still generated the results for catawiki's items by running it through the same clustering engine. 

# Why is clustering important ?

Catawiki is more of a want business than a need business, and when the user is there on the site, we have to appeal him into buying items that he loves. How would you know what the user loves ??? Well.... That's what the clustering and recommendation algorithm is for. To user personalized content based on his preferences and things that appeal him more.


# I don't have time to go through all the cluster folders in github folder, what should I do ???

If you are in rush, here's a picture of the folder on my mac for you to have a quick glance:

That's all âœ…
